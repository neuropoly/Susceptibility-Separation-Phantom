### Theory:
This repository can create an in-silico brain phantom containing positive and negative magnetic susceptibility ($\chi^+$ and $\chi^-$) values, where $\chi^+$ and $\chi^-$ represent the iron and myelin susceptibility contribution to the total susceptibility. The code to simulate $\chi^+$ and $\chi^-$ maps is based on an extension to the [QSM validation phantom](https://data.ru.nl/collections/di/dccn/DSC_3015069.02_542?0) $^1$ developed for the second QSM reconstruction challenge $^1$. Our phantom offers the option of considering the anisotropic nature of WM susceptibility, i.e., its orientation-dependent behavior relative to the main magnetic field. 

### Phantom creation:
Simulated $\chi^+$ and $\chi^-$ maps were generated by assigning susceptibility values from the literature $^{2–4}$ to respective tissue segments (Table 2). Subsequently, $\chi^+$ and $\chi^-$ were adjusted to ensure that their sum aligns with the $\chi^{tot}$ values specified in the QSM challenge 2.0, which represents the total magnetic susceptibility.
 
Pre-scanned $R_{1}$ and $R^{\*}_ {2}$ maps (from the original QSM phantom) were used to create an anatomically valid intensity modulation for susceptibility values using the same approach as that of Marques et al. $^1$:

$$
\bar{\chi}^{\pm}_ {\text{tissue}}(r) = \bar{\chi}^{\pm}_ {\text{tissue}}(r) + a_{\text{tissue}}(R^{\*}_ {2}(r) - \bar{R}^{\*}_ {2}) + b_{\text{tissue}}(R_{1}(r) - \bar{R}_{1})
$$



where $\bar{\chi}^{\pm}_ {\text{tissue}}$ are the values from Table 1, $R_{1}$ and $R^{\*}_ {2}$  are the longitudinal and observed transverse relaxation maps with $\bar{R}_ {1}$  and $\bar{R}^{\*}_ {2}$  being their mean value for a given brain region and $a_{\text{tissue}}$ and $b_{\text{tissue}}$ are weighting factors. 
Our custom phantom offers the possibility of including WM’s susceptibility anisotropy by modeling $\chi^-$ as:

$$
(\chi_{||} - \chi_{\perp}) \cos^2 \theta + \chi_{0}
$$

Where $\chi_{||}$ and $\chi_{\perp}$ are the susceptibility of myelinated fibers along and perpendicular to their principal axis, $\theta$ is the fiber-to-field angle, and $\chi_{0}$ represents any orientation-independent susceptibility. $\chi_{||}$, $\chi_{\perp}$, and $\chi_{0}$ maps were generated from literature values $^{5–7}$ (Table 1) that were subsequently weighted using the $R_{1}$ map and subjected to Gaussian noise in order to add texture to the tissue regions.

Finally, our phantom allows us to simulate a transversal relaxation time $R_2$ map $\(\frac{1}{T_2}\)$. This map was also simulated based on literature values $^{8,9}$ (Table 3) and then weighed using $R^{\*}_ {2}$ and $M_0$ to create realistic tissue textures.

### Gradient echo simulation:
The created phantom can be used to simulate gradient-echo (GRE) data (3T or 7T) using the following equation:
 
$$S=M_0\sin(\alpha)\frac{1-e^{-TR.R_1}}{1-\cos(\alpha)e^{-TR.R_1}}e^{-TE.(R_2+D_r(|\chi^+|+|\chi^-|))+i(\Phi_0+2\pi{\gamma}TE.B_0(D*(\chi^++\chi^-)))}$$

where D is the magnetic dipole kernel, $\alpha$ is the flip angle, TR is the repetition time, TE is the echo time, $\Phi_0$ is a phase offset, $M_0$ is the net magnetization, $B_0$ is the field strength, 
${\gamma}$ is the gyromagnetic ratio, and $D_r$ maps represents the proportionality between $R^{\'}_ {2}$ $(=R^{\*}_ {2}-R_ 2)$ and absolute susceptibility. $D_r$ was modeled as $\tfrac{2\pi}{9\sqrt{3}}{\gamma}B_0$ in gray matter and as $\tfrac{1}{2}\gamma B_0sin^2(\theta)$ in white matter.

The phantom and accompanying code can be used to simulate MR signals and evaluate various magnetic susceptibility-separation techniques, such as [&chi;-separation](https://github.com/SNU-LIST/chi-separation) $^{10}$, [APART-QSM](https://github.com/AMRI-Lab/APART-QSM) $^{11}$, or DECOMPOSE QSM $^{12}$.

### Requirements:

- Susceptibility-separation-phantom repository.
- Matlab license.
- [Nifti toolbox.](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/8797-tools-for-nifti-and-analyze-image) 
- [QSM challenge 2.0 repository.](https://data.ru.nl/collections/di/dccn/DSC_3015069.02_542?1)

### Pre-Usage:

After downloading the QSM challenge 2.0 repository and this repository, replace the following files from the QSM Challenge 2.0 repository with the corresponding files from this repository:
```
     QSM Challenge 2.0 version                                      Our version               
 -------------------------------                                ---------------------      
 MacroCreateSusceptibilityPhantom.m           ------->            PhantomCreation.m          
 CreateOwnRealisticPhantom.m                  ------->            PhantomCreationFunction.m 
 MacroCreateSimulationData.m                  ------->            DataSimulation.m           
 CreateSimulatedData.m                        ------->            DataSimulationFunction.m   
 DataSimulation.m                             ------->            GRESimulation.m            
 parameters.mat                               ------->            SusceptibilityValues.mat   
```

In addition, make sure to add these files to the main QSM challenge file directory: **Mask.m, Anisotropy.m, T2_star.nii.gz, white_matter_mask.nii.gz**.

### Usage:
Once you have all of the required files, follow these steps to create positive and negative susceptibility maps and simulate gradient-echo data:
1) To create susceptibility phantoms: run **PhantomCreation.m** 
 - This script will create susceptibility phantoms: $\chi^{tot}$ from QSM challenge 2.0 and additionally $\chi^{+}$ and $\chi^{-}$ phantoms with and without anisotropy.  In addition, it will simulate an $R_2$ map $\(\frac{1}{T_2}\)$. This script will also generate spatially variable and constant $D_r$ maps (to include or exclude anisotropy)

2) To simulate GRE magnitude and phase data: run **DataSimulation.m**
When simulating consider checking the input of the Anisotropy.m function
- if you want to simulate data with anisotropy select **Asotropy** as “true”.
-  if you want to simulate without anisotropy select **Anisotropy** as “ false”.
### Recommendations:
 
1) We recommend using this phantom for validating susceptibility separation algorithms. 

For this you will need the following script:
- CalculateR2prime.m: Calculate $R^{\'}_ {2}$ map from $R_2$ and $R^{\*}_ {2}$.
At this point, an $R_2$ map is already simulated. To obtain an $R^{\*}_ {2}$ map, we recommend applying a mono-exponential fitting to the simulated magnitude data using [**qMRLab software**](https://qmrlab.org/). 

2) To visualize a color-coded white matter fiber orientation map run the script: **GenerateRgbMap.m** 

### Results:

All the resulting maps are available in the repository as essential reference points for anyone seeking to reproduce the work.
